# Example Usage:

complex_wave.add_internal_process(c=1.0, phi_params=(1000, 500, 0.8), m=0.5, t=1.0) # Example parameters
complex_wave.add_internal_process(c=0.5, phi_params=(3000, 200, 1.2), m=1.0, t=0.5)

complex_wave.save_wav()
print("Complex wave file saved as complex_wave.wav")


Key improvements and explanations:
 * Frequency Domain Representation: The core of the ComplexWaveFile now works in the frequency domain using np.fft.fftfreq and stores the complex wave data in self.psi. This is crucial for manipulating frequency components directly, as the original equation suggests.
 * Wave Function Representations: The _phi and _gamma methods are introduced to represent Φᵢ(Ω) and Γⱼ(Ω) respectively. These are now functions that take frequency (omega) and parameters and return the appropriate wave function value. I've provided example implementations (Gaussian and Lorentzian), but you can easily change these to any function you need. The _phi function now includes an observer_effect parameter for demonstration.
 * Adding Processes and Influences: The add_internal_process and add_external_influence methods now correctly add the weighted and exponentially decayed wave functions to the overall self.psi in the frequency domain.
 * Waveform Generation: The generate_waveform method uses np.fft.ifft to convert the frequency domain representation (self.psi) back to the time domain waveform. The np.real() is important to take because inverse FFT can sometimes leave very small imaginary components due to numerical precision.
 * WAV File Saving: The save_wav function now correctly normalizes the waveform before converting it to int16 and saving it as a WAV file using scipy.signal.wavfile. This ensures proper audio playback.
 * Clearer Parameterization: The parameters for the wave functions and exponential terms are now passed as tuples or lists, making the code more readable and easier to modify.
 * Comments and Explanations: More comments and explanations have been added to the code to clarify its functionality.
This revised version provides a much more robust and functional framework for creating complex wave files based on your provided equation. You can now easily experiment with different wave functions, parameters, and combinations of internal processes and external influences. Remember to install scipy: pip install scipy

Explanation
 * Secure Storage: Encrypts sensitive quantum access parameters using Fernet for secure storage in quantum_access_spec.txt.
 * Cloud Integration: Includes a cloud_access_point parameter to specify the cloud service for quantum realm access.
 * AI Processing: Specifies an ai_processing_unit (e.g., "QPU-v1") for AI-based processing in the quantum realm.
 * Key Management: Encrypts and stores the encryption key within the file for secure access.
 * Android Integration: You can integrate this with your Android functions by reading the parameters from the file and using them to establish connections, send data for processing, and receive results.
Integration with Android
 * Add the cryptography library to your android_operator/requirements.txt.
 * In your android_operator/main.py or relevant module, call read_quantum_access_spec() to retrieve the parameters.
 * Use the parameters to establish a connection to the cloud service, send data for AI processing, and handle the results.
Important Considerations
 * Quantum Realm: The concept of accessing a "quantum realm" is currently theoretical. This code provides a framework for secure access to a hypothetical cloud-based quantum computing service.
 * Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging for production use.
 * Key Management: In a real-world scenario, consider more secure key management solutions (e.g., hardware security modules, key servers).
This example provides a starting point for creating a secure specification file for accessing and utilizing a hypothetical quantum computing service. You can adapt and expand it based on your specific requirements and the capabilities of the quantum computing platform you intend to integrate with.

 * Sensor Data Utilization: Shows an example of using sensor data to influence the dragonfly_systems (you can customize this based on your sensor data and dragonfly functions).
 * Clear Comments: Provides detailed comments to explain the code's logic and functionality.
Additional Notes
 * Remember to replace the placeholder comments (# ...) with your actual implementation code.
 * Ensure that the trained_autoencoder is loaded and accessible within ai_core.py.
 * The user_interactions variable would need to be updated based on how you capture user input in the UI.
 * Consider adding error handling and logging to make the code more robust.
This enhanced code provides a more comprehensive and integrated solution, bringing together the various components of your application. It demonstrates how to combine astral projection features, sensor data analysis, AI processing, and anomaly detection within a single function.

Explanation:
 * Encryption Key:
   * Uses secrets.token_bytes(32) to generate a cryptographically secure random key.
   * The key is hashed using SHA-256 for storage in the file. This adds a layer of security, as the raw key is not directly stored.
 * Encryption:
   * Uses the cryptography library (specifically, Fernet) for symmetric encryption.
   * Fernet is a secure and easy-to-use encryption implementation.
   * The data is serialized (converted to a string) before encryption.
 * Decryption:
   * Reads the encrypted key and data from the file.
   * Hashes the encrypted key to get the original decryption key.
   * Uses Fernet to decrypt the data.
   * Deserializes the decrypted data back into a Python dictionary.
 * Adaptability:
   * You can easily change the encryption algorithm or key generation method if needed.
   * The data argument can be any Python dictionary, making it flexible to store different types of information.
Security Considerations:
 * Key Management: The security of this system relies on the secrecy of the encryption key. In a real-world application, you would need to consider secure key storage and management practices.
 * Data Integrity: The code includes a hash of the key to ensure data integrity. You could add additional measures like message authentication codes (MACs) for stronger integrity checks.
 * Serialization: Be cautious when using eval() to deserialize data, especially if the data comes from untrusted sources. Consider using safer alternatives like json.loads() if you're working with JSON data.
To use this code:
 * Install the cryptography library:
   pip install cryptography

 * Save the code: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., secure_spec_generator.py).
 * Run the script: Execute the script from your terminal using python secure_spec_generator.py.
 * Output: This will create a file named secure_spec.txt with the encrypted data. The script will also print the decrypted data to the console to demonstrate that it works.
This code provides a solid foundation for creating secure specification files. Remember to adapt and enhance it further based on your specific security requirements and context.
# SODA: Protecting Proprietary Information in On-Device Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the implementation of SODA, a secure on-device application for machine learning model deployment, and experiments discussed in our ACM/IEEE SEC 2023 paper ["SODA: Protecting Proprietary Information in On-Device Machine Learning Models"](https://akanksha-atrey.github.io/papers/atrey2023soda.pdf).

## About

The growth of low-end hardware has led to a proliferation of machine learning-based services in edge applications. These applications gather contextual information about users and provide some services, such as personalized offers, through a machine learning (ML) model. A growing practice has been to deploy such ML models on the user’s device to reduce latency, maintain user privacy, and minimize continuous reliance on a centralized source. However, deploying ML models on the user’s edge device can leak proprietary information about the service provider. In this work, we investigate on-device ML models that are used to provide mobile services and demonstrate how simple attacks can leak proprietary information of the service provider. We show that different adversaries can easily exploit such models to maximize their profit and accomplish content theft. Motivated by the need to thwart such attacks, we present an end-to-end framework, SODA, for deploying and serving on edge devices while defending against adversarial usage. Our results demonstrate that SODA can detect adversarial usage with 89% accuracy in less than 50 queries with minimal impact on service performance, latency, and storage.

## Setup

### Python

This repository requires Python 3 (>=3.5).

### Packages

All packages used in this repository can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. The following command will install all the packages according to the configuration file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The experiments in this work are executed on two datasets: (1) [UCI Human Activity Recognition](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones), and (2) [MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Please download them into `data/UCI_HAR` and `data/MNIST`, respectively.

## Attacks

This repository contains two types of attacks: (1) exploiting output diversity, and (2) exploiting decision boundaries. The implementation of these attacks can be found in `src/attacks/class_attack.py` and `src/attacks/db_attack.py`, respectively. 

Note, the black box attacks (denoted with a "bb") often take longer to run. It may be worthwhile to run the experiments one at a time. Additionally, swarm scripts are present in the `swarm` folder which may assist further in running the attacks on a slurm-supported server.

### Exploiting Output Diversity

The code for attacking output diversity contains four experiments. To run the class attack that exploits output diversity, execute the following command:

`python3 -m src.attack.class_attack -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf -wb_query_attack true -wb_num_feat_attack true -bb_query_attack true -bb_unused_feat_attack true`

### Exploiting Decision Boundaries

The code for attacking decision boundaries contains five experiments. To run the decision boundary attack, execute the following command:

`python3 -m src.attack.db_attack -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf -noise_bounds "-0.01 0.01" -exp_num_query true -exp_num_query_bb true -exp_num_query_randfeat true -exp_query_distance true -exp_query_distribution true`

## SODA: Defending On-Device Models

The implementation of SODA can be found in the `src/defense` folder. 

### Training and Executing SODA

The first step is to train an autoencoder model for defending against the attacks. This can be done by executing the following command:

`python3 -m src.defense.defense_training -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf`

Following the training of the autoencoder defender, the following command can be executed to run experiments on SODA:

`python3 -m src.defense.defense_detector -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf -noise_bounds "-0.01 0.01" -num_queries 100`

### Deploying SODA: A Prototype

A prototype of SODA can be found in the `prototype` folder. This prototype was deployed on a Raspberry Pi.# --- Directory Structure ---

Explanation:
 * Encryption Key:
   * Uses secrets.token_bytes(32) to generate a cryptographically secure random key.
   * The key is hashed using SHA-256 for storage in the file. This adds a layer of security, as the raw key is not directly stored.
 * Encryption:
   * Uses the cryptography library (specifically, Fernet) for symmetric encryption.
   * Fernet is a secure and easy-to-use encryption implementation.
   * The data is serialized (converted to a string) before encryption.
 * Decryption:
   * Reads the encrypted key and data from the file.
   * Hashes the encrypted key to get the original decryption key.
   * Uses Fernet to decrypt the data.
   * Deserializes the decrypted data back into a Python dictionary.
 * Adaptability:
   * You can easily change the encryption algorithm or key generation method if needed.
   * The data argument can be any Python dictionary, making it flexible to store different types of information.
Security Considerations:
 * Key Management: The security of this system relies on the secrecy of the encryption key. In a real-world application, you would need to consider secure key storage and management practices.
 * Data Integrity: The code includes a hash of the key to ensure data integrity. You could add additional measures like message authentication codes (MACs) for stronger integrity checks.
 * Serialization: Be cautious when using eval() to deserialize data, especially if the data comes from untrusted sources. Consider using safer alternatives like json.loads() if you're working with JSON data.
To use this code:
 * Install the cryptography library:
   pip install cryptography

 * Save the code: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., secure_spec_generator.py).
 * Run the script: Execute the script from your terminal using python secure_spec_generator.py.
 * Output: This will create a file named secure_spec.txt with the encrypted data. The script will also print the decrypted data to the console to demonstrate that it works.
This code provides a solid foundation for creating secure specification files. Remember to adapt and enhance it further based on your specific security requirements and context.
# SODA: Protecting Proprietary Information in On-Device Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the implementation of SODA, a secure on-device application for machine learning model deployment, and experiments discussed in our ACM/IEEE SEC 2023 paper ["SODA: Protecting Proprietary Information in On-Device Machine Learning Models"](https://akanksha-atrey.github.io/papers/atrey2023soda.pdf).

If you use this code or are inspired by our methodology, please cite our SEC paper:

## About

The growth of low-end hardware has led to a proliferation of machine learning-based services in edge applications. These applications gather contextual information about users and provide some services, such as personalized offers, through a machine learning (ML) model. A growing practice has been to deploy such ML models on the user’s device to reduce latency, maintain user privacy, and minimize continuous reliance on a centralized source. However, deploying ML models on the user’s edge device can leak proprietary information about the service provider. In this work, we investigate on-device ML models that are used to provide mobile services and demonstrate how simple attacks can leak proprietary information of the service provider. We show that different adversaries can easily exploit such models to maximize their profit and accomplish content theft. Motivated by the need to thwart such attacks, we present an end-to-end framework, SODA, for deploying and serving on edge devices while defending against adversarial usage. Our results demonstrate that SODA can detect adversarial usage with 89% accuracy in less than 50 queries with minimal impact on service performance, latency, and storage.

## Setup

### Python

This repository requires Python 3 (>=3.5).

### Packages

All packages used in this repository can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. The following command will install all the packages according to the configuration file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The experiments in this work are executed on two datasets: (1) [UCI Human Activity Recognition](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones), and (2) [MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Please download them into `data/UCI_HAR` and `data/MNIST`, respectively.

## Attacks

This repository contains two types of attacks: (1) exploiting output diversity, and (2) exploiting decision boundaries. The implementation of these attacks can be found in `src/attacks/class_attack.py` and `src/attacks/db_attack.py`, respectively. 

Note, the black box attacks (denoted with a "bb") often take longer to run. It may be worthwhile to run the experiments one at a time. Additionally, swarm scripts are present in the `swarm` folder which may assist further in running the attacks on a slurm-supported server.

### Exploiting Output Diversity

The code for attacking output diversity contains four experiments. To run the class attack that exploits output diversity, execute the following command:

`python3 -m src.attack.class_attack -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf -wb_query_attack true -wb_num_feat_attack true -bb_query_attack true -bb_unused_feat_attack true`

### Exploiting Decision Boundaries

The code for attacking decision boundaries contains five experiments. To run the decision boundary attack, execute the following command:

`python3 -m src.attack.db_attack -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf -noise_bounds "-0.01 0.01" -exp_num_query true -exp_num_query_bb true -exp_num_query_randfeat true -exp_query_distance true -exp_query_distribution true`

## SODA: Defending On-Device Models

The implementation of SODA can be found in the `src/defense` folder. 

### Training and Executing SODA

The first step is to train an autoencoder model for defending against the attacks. This can be done by executing the following command:

`python3 -m src.defense.defense_training -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf`

Following the training of the autoencoder defender, the following command can be executed to run experiments on SODA:

`python3 -m src.defense.defense_detector -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf -noise_bounds "-0.01 0.01" -num_queries 100`

### Deploying SODA: A Prototype

A prototype of SODA can be found in the `prototype` folder. This prototype was deployed on a Raspberry Pi.

    "license": "SODA: @inproceedings{atrey2023soda,...}",  # Include full citation

retrieved_mit_data = read_secure_spec_file("mit_spec.txt")

print("SODA Data:", retrieved_soda_data)
print("MIT Data:", retrieved_mit_data) 

Key improvements
 * License enforcement: The code now requires license information to be included in the data dictionary, ensuring that every spec file has proper licensing.
 * License validation: The read_secure_spec_file function checks for the presence of the "license" key in the decrypted data. You can add more specific validation logic here to check the license details (e.g., parsing the SODA citation, verifying the copyright in the MIT license).
 * Example usage: The example demonstrates how to create spec files with both SODA and MIT licenses, making it clear how to use the API for different licensing scenarios.
 * Error handling: Includes try-except blocks to handle potential errors during file reading and writing.
Remember
 * This code still uses eval() for deserialization. Consider using json.loads() if you're working with JSON data for better security.
 * Key management is crucial. In a real-world application, you would need a secure way to store and manage the encryption keys.
 * You can extend this code to support other licenses and add more robust license validation mechanisms.
# SODA: Protecting Proprietary Information in On-Device Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the implementation of SODA, a secure on-device application for machine learning model deployment, and experiments discussed in our ACM/IEEE SEC 2023 paper ["SODA: Protecting Proprietary Information in On-Device Machine Learning Models"](https://akanksha-atrey.github.io/papers/atrey2023soda.pdf).

## About

The growth of low-end hardware has led to a proliferation of machine learning-based services in edge applications. These applications gather contextual information about users and provide some services, such as personalized offers, through a machine learning (ML) model. A growing practice has been to deploy such ML models on the user’s device to reduce latency, maintain user privacy, and minimize continuous reliance on a centralized source. However, deploying ML models on the user’s edge device can leak proprietary information about the service provider. In this work, we investigate on-device ML models that are used to provide mobile services and demonstrate how simple attacks can leak proprietary information of the service provider. We show that different adversaries can easily exploit such models to maximize their profit and accomplish content theft. Motivated by the need to thwart such attacks, we present an end-to-end framework, SODA, for deploying and serving on edge devices while defending against adversarial usage. Our results demonstrate that SODA can detect adversarial usage with 89% accuracy in less than 50 queries with minimal impact on service performance, latency, and storage.

## Setup

### Python

This repository requires Python 3 (>=3.5).

### Packages

All packages used in this repository can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. The following command will install all the packages according to the configuration file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The experiments in this work are executed on two datasets: (1) [UCI Human Activity Recognition](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones), and (2) [MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Please download them into `data/UCI_HAR` and `data/MNIST`, respectively.

## Attacks

This repository contains two types of attacks: (1) exploiting output diversity, and (2) exploiting decision boundaries. The implementation of these attacks can be found in `src/attacks/class_attack.py` and `src/attacks/db_attack.py`, respectively. 

Note, the black box attacks (denoted with a "bb") often take longer to run. It may be worthwhile to run the experiments one at a time. Additionally, swarm scripts are present in the `swarm` folder which may assist further in running the attacks on a slurm-supported server.

### Exploiting Output Diversity

The code for attacking output diversity contains four experiments. To run the class attack that exploits output diversity, execute the following command:

`python3 -m src.attack.class_attack -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf -wb_query_attack true -wb_num_feat_attack true -bb_query_attack true -bb_unused_feat_attack true`

### Exploiting Decision Boundaries

The code for attacking decision boundaries contains five experiments. To run the decision boundary attack, execute the following command:

`python3 -m src.attack.db_attack -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf -noise_bounds "-0.01 0.01" -exp_num_query true -exp_num_query_bb true -exp_num_query_randfeat true -exp_query_distance true -exp_query_distribution true`

## SODA: Defending On-Device Models

The implementation of SODA can be found in the `src/defense` folder. 

### Training and Executing SODA

The first step is to train an autoencoder model for defending against the attacks. This can be done by executing the following command:

`python3 -m src.defense.defense_training -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf`

Following the training of the autoencoder defender, the following command can be executed to run experiments on SODA:

`python3 -m src.defense.defense_detector -data_name UCI_HAR -model_type rf -noise_bounds "-0.01 0.01" -num_queries 100`

### Deploying SODA: A Prototype

A prototype of SODA can be found in the `prototype` folder. This prototype was deployed on a Raspberry Pi.
