# Multiverse App

This is a cross-platform application that generates a dynamic soundscape based on sensor data and AI processing.

## Features

* Generates immersive audio experiences using various sound synthesis techniques.
* Integrates sensor data to influence the generated soundscape.
* Utilizes AI for audio processing and analysis.
* Transmits audio data via Bluetooth or WiFi.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Kivy
* pydub
* librosa
* gtts
* numpy
* jnius (for Android)
* tensorflow

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiverse-app.git`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   * Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
   * Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` in each operator directory (android_operator/ and apple_operator/)

### Running the App

1.  Navigate to the desired operator directory (android_operator/ or apple_operator/).
2.  Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Running Tests

Run tests using `python -m unittest discover -s tests`

Key improvements and explanations:
 * Frequency Domain Representation: The core of the ComplexWaveFile now works in the frequency domain using np.fft.fftfreq and stores the complex wave data in self.psi. This is crucial for manipulating frequency components directly, as the original equation suggests.
 * Wave Function Representations: The _phi and _gamma methods are introduced to represent Φᵢ(Ω) and Γⱼ(Ω) respectively. These are now functions that take frequency (omega) and parameters and return the appropriate wave function value. I've provided example implementations (Gaussian and Lorentzian), but you can easily change these to any function you need. The _phi function now includes an observer_effect parameter for demonstration.
 * Adding Processes and Influences: The add_internal_process and add_external_influence methods now correctly add the weighted and exponentially decayed wave functions to the overall self.psi in the frequency domain.
 * Waveform Generation: The generate_waveform method uses np.fft.ifft to convert the frequency domain representation (self.psi) back to the time domain waveform. The np.real() is important to take because inverse FFT can sometimes leave very small imaginary components due to numerical precision.
 * WAV File Saving: The save_wav function now correctly normalizes the waveform before converting it to int16 and saving it as a WAV file using scipy.signal.wavfile. This ensures proper audio playback.
 * Clearer Parameterization: The parameters for the wave functions and exponential terms are now passed as tuples or lists, making the code more readable and easier to modify.
 * Comments and Explanations: More comments and explanations have been added to the code to clarify its functionality.
This revised version provides a much more robust and functional framework for creating complex wave files based on your provided equation. You can now easily experiment with different wave functions, parameters, and combinations of internal processes and external influences. Remember to install scipy: pip install scipy
